# FEox
Low Tier Ironman Framework for SSBM

## What is it?
FEox is a pun combining `Fe` being `Iron` and Fox being the most viable character in melee.
The idea is to provide a framework for creating teams for a "low tier ironman" and to eventually provide more tracking features like randomizing the bracket and tracking progress.

## What is a low tier iron man?
The melee character pool (or cast) has been divided (by the community's general opinion) into different tiers, denoting which characters are good and which are not. 
A low tier ironman breaks the tierlist into 6 different catagories, with each tier's character's prices ranging from 0-5.
Players have 15 "points" to spend to create a team of 5 (unique) cast emembers, meaning that they must select some of the lower tier characters.
