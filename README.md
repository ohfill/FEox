# FeOX
The Low Tier Ironman Framework for SSBM

## What is it?
FeOX is a pun combining `Fe` being `Iron` and `Fox` being widely regarded as the best character in melee.
The idea of this project is to provide a framework for creating teams for a "low tier ironman."

Eventually this project will be able to provide more tournament ready features such as seeding and initial bracket generation, and tracking player's progress through that bracket. It is currently a static webpage with all processing taking place in front-end javascript. Someday there may be a backend and DB support, but for now the app is persistant only between page refreshes.

## What is a low tier iron man?
The melee character pool (or cast) has been divided (by the community's general opinion) into different tiers, denoting which characters are good and which are not. 

A low tier ironman breaks the tier-list into 6 different catagories, with each tier's character's price ranging from 0-5.
Players have 15 "points" to spend to create a team of 5 (unique) cast members, meaning that they must select some of the lower tier characters, thus the name "low tier" iron man (in a normal iron man players are allowed to use any 5 characters from the cast).

## How to use
Fortunatly since this project is (currently) all front end, all you need to do to get started is open the `index.html` page in your favorite browser.

Enter a team name at the bottom of the cast list and press enter. Then click on characters to add them to your team.
